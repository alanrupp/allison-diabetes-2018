# Allison et al. *Diabetes* 2018

This contains the count data from my mapping of the raw data in Allison et al. and an analysis file to recapitulate the results in that paper. This is not the actual results from the paper, but it's based on the original sequencing data.

# Files
* `counts`: folder containing all count files with the pattern `Sample_[0-9]ReadsPerGenes.out.tab`
* **analysis.R**: `R` script for analysis of the count data
* **mapping.py**: `python` script for mapping the original FASTQ files
* **samples.csv**: metadata describing the cells, treatment, and mutations for each sample

# Outputs
* **counts.csv**: count file for uploading to GEO generated by the **mapping.py** and the **analysis.R** files
* **tx2gene.csv**: file generated from the GTF that maps Ensembl gene_id to gene_name
